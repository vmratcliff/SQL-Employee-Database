# SQL - Employee Database

For this project, used PostgreSQL to create an Employee Database using data from six CSV files on employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s.
The following were used for this project:

1. Data Modeling

2. Data Engineering

3. Data Analysis


## Data Modeling

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables. 

## Data Engineering

* Use the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis

Perform SQL queries to answer the following questions:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. List employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
